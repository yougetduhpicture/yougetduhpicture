- 👋 Hi, I’m @yougetduhpicture. Most people know me as Rasmus, though. I'm currently rocking the world as a bass player in Us.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, UX/UI design, music, branding, reading and photography
- 🌱 I've been learning full-stack development for the past few years, and the next thing I'll learn is writing tests
- 💞️ I can help you with programming and usability projects.
- 📫 You can reach me via email: ruonakoski.rasmus@gmail.com
